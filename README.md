## ℹ️ Overview

I am a math tutor, and this application was created for my students so they can **effectively practice interpreting properties of functions from graphs**.  
With Function Solver, you can practice:
- finding zeros of functions,
- identifying monotonicity,
- evaluating function values,
- locating local extrema,
- and other essential properties.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Kotlin Multiplatform** – for cross-platform development
- **Compose Multiplatform** – for building the UI
- **GitHub Pages** – for hosting the web version

The same core module will also be available on **mobile devices** as part of my commercial application **DayMath**.
